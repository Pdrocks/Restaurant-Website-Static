                    There’s nothing cookie-cutter about SS Restaurant. Not our food. Not our people.
                     And definitely not the way we live life. Around here, we don’t settle for anything less 
                     than food we’re proud to serve. And we don’t just clock in. Not when we can also become our best, make friends, 
                     and have fun while we’re at it. We’re the food company that lives life unboxed.

                    We’re not for people who want to blend in: pushing boundaries is part of our heritage. 
                    We have more than 16 restaurants  in India.

                <div class="right">
                    At SS Restaurant, we don’t just make food.
                     We make people happy. SS Restaurant was built on the belief that dinner should be special,
                      and we carry that belief into everything we do. With more than 55 years of experience under our belts, 
                      we understand how to best serve our customers through tried and true service principles: 
                      We create food we’re proud to serve and deliver it fast, with a smile.

                <div class="right">
                    SS Restaurant starts its journey from selling "thalis" only . 
                    The response is so good that our costumers wants to appreciate  
                    the chefs and our team for wonderfull food we made. Since then "Thalis"  
                    became our special food item till now.you must try out "SS special thali" 
                    at our restaurant .  
                </div>

            <p><span class ="left" >why is the name "SS Restaurant"</span>
                <div class="right">
                    when our restaurant starts, its name was "thali wala".
                    but as per time ,our costumer request us to include other food 
                     item as well , so we start selling other food items also other 
                     than thali . since than founder of our restaurant comes with a name
                     "SS Restaurant".
